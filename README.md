# Gradie's Grueling Grind
Those damn adventurers! They've chased you, a defenseless Kobold, deep into this cave system and away from the rest of your tribe. Now you have to figure your way home though you feel hopelessly lost. Explore the cave and deal with the adventurers along the way in order to get back to the other Kobolds!

## About the Game
This is going to be a top down 2D rouge-like dungeon crawler! The game will start in a safe area, but after that all other rooms will have some sort of danger in it that you can combat or attempt to run away from. The game will have permanent death, where the player has to start over completely every time they die. Eventually you may run into your tribe and then the game will be over.

## Tech Being Used
* HTML/CSS - Canvas to hold the game
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap for page styling
* PhaserJS 2 for game logic.

## MVP Checklist
* Render the starting area
* Render a random room when a player goes through a door
* Render enemies within a room
* Have player able to attack enemies
* Have enemies able to attack players
* Track a health bar for the player
* Have an end state once a player's health is 0.
* Keep track of how long the player stays alive. - Counter, clock, how many enemies killed, etc.

## Stretch Goals
* Have different types of attack for players (ie stab, range, magic)
* Have different types of enemies that have different level of difficulties
* Have items that help the player (Health potions, armor, magical items(?))
* Have doors that you can't just walk through. (Need a key, or a magical item, or to defeat all monsters in the room)
* Having a winning state where you find the tribe and made it through the caves.
